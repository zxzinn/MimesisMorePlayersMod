## 📖 Description

This mod patches the multiplayer player limit in MIMESIS, allowing more than 4 players to join a single session. The mod uses HarmonyX patches to modify server-side validation checks.

**Default limit:** 4 players  
**Modified limit:** 999 players (effectively unlimited)

### How It Works

The mod patches multiple validation points:
1. **Network Layer:** `FishySteamworks.Server.ServerSocket` - Steam networking limits
2. **Room Validation:** `VRoomManager.EnterWaitingRoom` - Server-side room entry checks  
3. **Member Count:** `VWaitingRoom.GetMemberCount()` - Player count validation

> ⚠️ **Important:** While the mod removes the technical limit, the actual number of players depends on:
> - Host's network bandwidth and latency
> - Steam P2P connection capabilities
> - Game performance (more players = more resource usage)

## 🎯 Who Needs This Mod?

### ✅ **ONLY THE HOST** needs to install this mod!

The mod patches **server-side validation** that happens on the host's game instance. Players joining the lobby **do NOT need** to install the mod.

**Installation:**
- **Host (lobby creator):** ✅ Must install mod
- **Joining players:** ❌ No mod needed

This makes it easy to play with friends - only the person hosting needs the mod!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```
1. Download MorePlayers.dll
2. Place in: <MIMESIS>/Mods/MorePlayers.dll
3. HOST creates lobby (mod installed)
4. Friends join (NO mod needed)
5. Enjoy 5+ player sessions! 🎉
```

**📌 Remember:** Only the HOST (lobby creator) needs the mod installed!

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Removes 4-player limit
- ✅ Patches server-side player count validation
- ✅ Logging for debugging
- ✅ No game file modifications required
- ✅ Easy to install and uninstall

## 📋 Requirements

- **MIMESIS** (Steam version)
- **[MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases)** v0.6.1 or higher
- Windows OS
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher

## 🔧 Installation

### Step 1: Install MelonLoader

1. Download the latest MelonLoader installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases)
2. Run the installer and select your MIMESIS installation folder:
   - Default Steam location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MIMESIS`
   - Or right-click MIMESIS in Steam → Manage → Browse local files
3. Click Install
4. Launch the game once to let MelonLoader initialize (game will close automatically)

### Step 2: Install the Mod

1. Download `MorePlayers.dll` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Copy `MorePlayers.dll` to your MIMESIS Mods folder:
   ```
   <MIMESIS_Install_Folder>/Mods/MorePlayers.dll
   ```
3. Launch the game

### Verify Installation

Check if the mod loaded successfully:
1. Navigate to `<MIMESIS_Install_Folder>/MelonLoader/Latest.log`
2. Look for these lines:
   ```
   [MorePlayers] MorePlayers Mod Loaded!
   [MorePlayers] Applying Harmony patches...
   [MorePlayers] Harmony patches applied successfully!
   ```

## 🎮 Usage

Once installed, the mod works automatically:

1. **Host a game** - The player limit is now 999
2. **Check the log** - When creating a lobby, you'll see:
   ```
   [MorePlayers] SetMaximumClients(4) called, setting to 999 instead
   [MorePlayers] GetMaximumClients() called, returning 999
   ```
3. **Invite players** - You can now have more than 4 players in your session!

## 🔍 How It Works

The mod uses [HarmonyX](https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX) to patch multiple server-side methods:

### Active Patches (6 total)

1. **GetMaximumClients()** - Prefix patch returns 999
2. **SetMaximumClients()** - Prefix patch prevents setting limit < 999
3. **ServerSocket Constructor** - Postfix sets `_maximumClients = 999`
4. **ServerSocket Methods** - IL Transpiler replaces field reads
5. **EnterWaitingRoom()** - IL Transpiler (attempts to replace constant 4)
6. **GetMemberCount()** - Prefix patch returns 0 to bypass `>= 4` check ⭐ **KEY PATCH**

### Key Innovation - PATCH 6

Instead of trying to modify the check `if (count >= 4)`, we make `GetMemberCount()` return `0`:
```csharp
// Original code:
if (vwaitingRoom.GetMemberCount() >= 4) { /* block player */ }

// With our patch:
if (0 >= 4) { /* never executes! */ }
```

**Target Classes:** 
- `FishySteamworks.Server.ServerSocket`
- `VRoomManager`  
- `VWaitingRoom`

## 🎮 Testing the Mod

### Expected Behavior

When the 5th player tries to join your lobby:

1. **In the log** you should see:
   ```
   [PATCH 6] GetMemberCount() called - actual: 4, returning: 0 (to bypass >= 4 check)
   ```

2. **Player successfully joins** instead of getting "Lobby Full" error

3. **You can repeat** for 6th, 7th, 8th+ players

### How to Test

1. **Host creates lobby** (host must have mod installed)
2. **4 players join** (no mod needed for them)
3. **5th player attempts to join** (watch the log!)
4. **Check results:**
   - ✅ Success: Player joins, log shows PATCH 6 messages
   - ❌ Failed: Player blocked, send me the full log

### Verifying Installation

Check `MelonLoader/Latest.log` for:

```
MorePlayers Mod v1.0.3 - Initializing...
SUCCESS: All Harmony patches applied!
Active patches:
  [1] GetMaximumClients() - Prefix
  [2] SetMaximumClients() - Prefix
  [3] Constructor - Postfix
  [4] Transpiler - IL Code Modification
  [5] EnterWaitingRoom - Transpiler (VRoomManager)
  [6] DISABLED (was causing crashes)

[PATCH 6] Target found: VWaitingRoom.GetMemberCount()
[PATCH 6] Will return max(actualCount, 0) to bypass >= 4 check
```

If you see this, the mod is loaded correctly! ✅

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Mod doesn't load (0 Mods loaded)

**Check:**
```powershell
# Verify the file exists
Test-Path "<MIMESIS_Folder>/Mods/MorePlayers.dll"
```

**Solutions:**
- Ensure MelonLoader is properly installed
- Unblock the DLL: Right-click → Properties → Check "Unblock" → Apply
- Make sure the file is in the correct `Mods` folder
- Restart the game

### Harmony patch errors in log

If you see errors like:
```
HarmonyLib.HarmonyException: Patching exception in method...
```

**Possible causes:**
- Game was updated and code structure changed
- Conflict with another mod
- Corrupted mod file

**Solutions:**
- Download the latest version of the mod
- Try disabling other mods temporarily
- Check the [Issues](../../issues) page

### Game crashes on startup

1. Remove the mod temporarily:
   ```powershell
   del "<MIMESIS_Folder>/Mods/MorePlayers.dll"
   ```
2. Check the last lines in `MelonLoader/Latest.log` before the crash
3. Report the issue with the log file

### Players still can't join after 4

**Possible reasons:**
- Steam P2P connection limits
- Host's network configuration (NAT, firewall)
- Additional client-side checks (not yet patched)
- Game server browser limitations

**Check the log** for messages like:
```
[MorePlayers] GetMaximumClients() called, returning 999
```
If you see this, the mod is working, but there might be other limitations.

**CRITICAL FIX:**
- **[PATCH 10]** ⭐ DeathMatchPlayerResult Array Expansion

  - **Impact:** Results screen now works with unlimited players!

**How it works:**
- Scans all methods working with `DeathMatchPlayerResult[]`
